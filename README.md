Ligric is an API manager for various crypto exchanges. This means that you can add any number of APIs to the application, distribute them to other users, or remove them.
The APIs themselves are sent to the server side, so the clients themselves who work with the APIs do not know anything about them. This is necessary for security and flexible handling.
